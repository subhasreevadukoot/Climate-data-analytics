python -m nltk.downloader stopwords
python -m nltk.downloader punkt
python -m nltk.downloader wordnet
python -m nltk.downloader stopwords
python -m nltk.downloader punkt

Requirements to run the source code of this project

1. The programs were created in Windows 10 Operating System with Python 3.7 version using Django.
However, the program works well in any operating system since it is platform independent.
2. Tableau workbooks are published using Tableau Server. Hence the workbooks are not required for running the Web Application. 
3. Internet connection is required as weather data is collected from Weather API using Internet. 


A zipped file of all the source codes along with the README file is submitted for grading. 


Motivation:

The project was developed for the requirement of Master's in Big Data Management and Analytics Dissertation. 



Datasets used:

1. climate change sentiment dataset from Kaggle.
The dataset is owned by Canada Foundation for Innovation JELF Grant to Chris Bauch, University of Waterloo.
https://www.kaggle.com/edqian/twitter-climate-change-sentiment-dataset

Datasets used to create Tableau workbook

1. Global Ecological Footprint
https://www.kaggle.com/footprintnetwork/ecological-footprint

2. COâ‚‚ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions
https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions



TEST 

To run the program, go to command prompt and cd to the Project Files directory.

Enter:

> python manage.py runserver

Then go to localhost:8000 in a browser of your choice. 



In case you want to see the algorithm report in command line, go to Project files>firstapp>views.py and uncomment the 5 method calls in home().
However, this report is already part of the home page of the User interface.
